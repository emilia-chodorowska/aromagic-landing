# Aromagic — The Platform for doTERRA Consultants

**All the tools you need to run your doTERRA business — in one place.**

---

## The Problem

Running a doTERRA business means tracking dozens of data points daily: who placed an order, how much OV each leg has, what prices apply in each market, who needs support. Most consultants manage this with Excel spreadsheets, phone notes, and manually copying data from the doTERRA portal.

This means:
- **Clunky doTERRA system** — slow, lacking features, and you still need Excel and notes on top of it
- **Time lost on calculations** — manually converting prices across currencies and preparing quotes takes time you could spend selling
- **Blind team management** — to check a client's history, structure orders, or unpaid orders you have to click through the portal page by page. No filters, no stats, no quick overview

## What Aromagic Gives You

Everything that takes minutes of clicking through the doTERRA portal, Aromagic gives you instantly.

### Clients & Orders
- **Any client's full history in one click** — orders, LRP status, discounts, loyalty points, favorite products. No portal digging.
- **Live structure orders** — instantly see who placed an order this month.
- **Returns after inactivity** — spot who came back after a break. A real opportunity to optimize your structure and boost earnings.
- **Orders outside LRP** — see who ordered without a template. You can still help them earn points while counting that volume toward your clusters.
- **Unpaid orders** — order number, PV value, and date — one click takes you straight to the order in the doTERRA portal.

### Stats & Analysis
- **Revenue breakdown** — how much comes from LRP, new enrollments, and regular cart orders. Know exactly what your business is made of.
- **Registration tracking** — which WA is generating enrollments, in which months, which are paid, what products they're for. All in one view.
- **PO3 clusters and PGV** — check any member's cluster fill status for the current month and their live PGV value in seconds.
- **Fast start calculator** — instantly see how much you'll earn from a given enrollment or order during fast start. No manual math.
- **Team retention** — stats on unique customers placing orders. Easily measure retention and see how active your team is month over month.
- **Full data history** — in the doTERRA portal, data older than 6 months is practically inaccessible. In Aromagic you have clear access to complete history with no restrictions.

### Structure Navigation
- **Advanced filtering** — by enroller, sponsor, fast start, PGV, inactivity, rank — any combination. Find exactly the members you're looking for.
- **Quick member search** — instantly find anyone in your structure, view their stats, and copy their ID in one click.
- **Tree view of your structure** — intuitively expand and collapse team branches. See who's under whom, drill down into the structure, and jump back in one click.
- **WA team structures at a glance** — quickly analyze any member's downline. See their structure, assess the situation, and give them targeted guidance.

### Rank Planning
Instant access to leg volumes for every member of your team. See where volume is missing and plan the next rank advancement — yours and your team's.

### Professional Price Calculations
Aromagic does the math for you. Add products to a cart, generate a calculation, and send your client a link — they see exact prices in their currency without your involvement. Calculation history and multi-market support.

### Loyalty Point Redemption
Check in seconds which products can be redeemed for free with loyalty points and how many points they cost. No more clicking through the slow doTERRA system or searching through PDFs.

### Product Catalog
Complete doTERRA product database with search, filters, and detailed information. Current prices across different markets, multi-language descriptions. No more browsing through PDF catalogs.

### doTERRA Portal Integration
Chrome extension that works directly on office.doterra.com and mydoterra.com. It pulls the freshest data from the doTERRA portal, so you always work with up-to-date information in Aromagic. Team data syncing requires a desktop browser — product catalog, price lists, and calculations work on any device.
