## PROBLEM

**Section headline:** Sound familiar?

- The doTERRA portal is slow, and data older than 6 months is practically gone
- Hours every week manually calculating prices, checking points, and analyzing your team in spreadsheets
- Checking a client's history or unpaid orders means clicking through the portal page by page
- With a team of 100+ people, it's not management — it's fighting your tools

**Summary:** Aromagic changes that. Everything that takes minutes of clicking in the portal, you get instantly here.
